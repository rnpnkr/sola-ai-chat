# Progress

## What works
- The basic project structure is defined in `README.md`.
- The `memory-bank` directory and initial core files have been created and updated.
- A basic FastAPI backend (`backend/main.py`) is set up to run the ElevenLabs conversation.
- The ElevenLabs conversation logic in `backend/elevenlabs_service.py` is refactored to be importable and includes timer-based state tracking (IDLE, SPEAKING, LISTENING, THINKING).
- A WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) in the backend sends state updates to connected clients.
- A basic React frontend (`frontend/`) is set up with waveform visualization components.
- The frontend connects to the backend WebSocket and receives state updates.
- The frontend waveform visualization is triggered by the `SPEAKING` state received from the backend.
- Audio input and output through the backend's default audio interface are working.

## What's left to build
- Full implementation of all features outlined in `README.md`.
- Refining frontend state handling for all conversation states.
- Implementing real-time audio streaming from backend to frontend for accurate waveform visualization based on actual audio data.
- Error handling and robust session management for WebSocket connections.
- User interface for conversation input and output in the frontend.
- Integration with other services (mem0, Supabase, etc.).
- Comprehensive testing.

## Current status
- Core backend and frontend structure for real-time state communication and basic waveform visualization is established.
- The project is progressing from foundational setup to initial feature implementation.

## Known issues
- State tracking for SPEAKING and IDLE relies on estimated duration/silence timeouts due to ElevenLabs Python SDK limitations, which may not be perfectly accurate.
- Waveform visualization is currently based on a placeholder audio element, not the actual ElevenLabs audio stream.
- WebSocket session management is basic (one conversation instance shared).
- Error handling for network issues or API problems needs improvement.
- Potential timing issues with state transitions based on timer values.
- The THINKING state transition currently relies on a timer after user speech; a more direct signal might be needed if available from the SDK in the future.
