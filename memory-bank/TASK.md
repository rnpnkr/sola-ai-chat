# TASK.md

## Development Roadmap Tasks

### Phase 1 - MVP (Hackathon)
- [ ] Implement single AI companion personality
- [x] Implement basic voice conversation capabilities (Backend setup and basic state tracking via WebSocket)
- [ ] Implement simple memory and context retention
- [x] Develop core mobile interface (Basic React frontend structure with waveform visualization component)

### Phase 2 - Enhanced Features
- [ ] Implement multiple agent personalities
- [ ] Integrate advanced memory system with mem0
- [ ] Implement progress tracking and analytics
- [ ] Develop web application (Frontend refinement)

### Phase 3 - Production Ready
- [ ] Implement crisis detection and intervention
- [ ] Integrate professional services (therapy practices)
- [ ] Implement subscription monetization (RevenueCat)
- [ ] Implement advanced personalization

## Discovered During Work
- [ ] Refine frontend state handling for all conversation states (LISTENING, THINKING, IDLE)
- [ ] Implement real-time audio streaming from backend to frontend for accurate waveform visualization
- [ ] Improve WebSocket error handling and session management
- [ ] Implement user interface for conversation input and output 

## Phase: Mobile VUI

### Required Components
- [ ] `VoiceAIVisualizer.tsx` - Main visualization component
- [ ] `ParticleSystem.tsx` - Particle effects manager
- [ ] `WaveformRenderer.tsx` - 3D waveform rendering (simulated 3D)
- [ ] `StateTransitionManager.tsx` - Animation orchestrator
- [ ] `DebugControls.tsx` - Development state switcher

### Required Hooks
- [ ] `useAudioAnalyzer` - Process audio input/output
- [ ] `useStateTransition` - Manage state animations
- [ ] `usePerformanceMonitor` - Track FPS and metrics

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Create test scenarios for rapid state changes
- [ ] Create test scenarios for low-end device performance
- [ ] Create test scenarios for extended usage (memory leaks)
- [ ] Create test scenarios for state transition interruptions
- [ ] Create test scenarios for background/foreground transitions

### Implementation Phases (Based on PRD Priority)
- [x] Phase 1: Basic state visualization with simple transitions
- [ ] Phase 2: Particle system and 3D waveform (simulated)
- [ ] Phase 3: Advanced animations and performance optimization
- [ ] Phase 4: Polish, micro-interactions, and accessibility
