## ElevenLabs State Tracking Workaround
- Due to the ElevenLabs Python SDK lacking a direct `onModeChange` callback or easy access to real-time audio output status, conversation state (especially SPEAKING and IDLE) is currently inferred using timer-based estimations in the `ConversationStateManager`.
- The estimation for SPEAKING duration is based on text length and an assumed speaking rate.
- This is a known limitation and workaround. If future SDK versions provide more direct audio status or state events, the implementation should be updated for accuracy.
